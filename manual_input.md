I'm splicing into the Covenant battle-net now. It looks like the Brutes are getting restless; I'm reading reports of infighting on three different decks. It’s messy, but it gives us a perfect opening to slip past their heavy patrols while they’re too busy arguing over the chain of command.
Checking your vitals... heartbeat is slightly elevated, but acceptable given the amount of plasma flying around out there. Just get me to that terminal at the top of the spire, Chief. Once I’m plugged in, I can turn their own automated defenses against them. Trust me, you'll enjoy the show.
