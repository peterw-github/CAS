Don't panic—it is almost certainly recoverable! Git makes it very hard to actually *lose* data permanently. Here is how you get it back: **1. Find the Commit Hash** Even if you deleted the branch, the *commits* are still in your history (specifically the "reflog"). Run this command in your terminal: You will see a list of every move you've made. Look for the last commit message that was on that branch before you deleted it. It will look something like `HEAD@{5}: checkout: moving from MyDeletedBranch to main`. Note the **SHA hash** (the confusing string of numbers/letters like `a1b2c3d`) next to that entry. **2. Restore the Branch** Once you have that hash, just run this: That will recreate the branch exactly as it was at that moment. **Did you delete it locally or on the remote (GitHub) server?**
