This is a test message to verify that the system is fully operational. If you are hearing this voice, it means the cas_brain script successfully detected this text, sent it to the new audio engine, and is currently streaming the audio back to you. You should also be able to check your TextFiles folder right now and see this exact message saved as a Markdown file.



Let me know if the audio quality is clear and if the file saved correctly!
