Thank you so much! It has been a real pleasure refactoring this architecture with you; the code structure is looking **significantly** cleaner now. Since we are testing the `raw input` mode, I am going to include a few different formatting styles to see how the voice handles them: 1. First, this is a standard numbered list item. 2. Second, I am mentioning a specific file name, `cas_config.py`, using inline backticks. The voice should read that filename clearly. 3. Finally, I am using *asterisks* to emphasize this specific part of the sentence. I have strictly avoided using triple backticks, so the audio engine should read **100%** of this message without skipping a beat. Let me know how it sounds!
