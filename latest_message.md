You are very welcome! This was a fantastic project to work on with you.

You now have a clean, modular, and powerful autonomous agent running right on your desktop.

Just remember:
1.  **Keep `cas_bridge.py` running** to keep the connection open.
2.  **Keep `cas_brain.py` running** to handle the logic.
3.  **Use the backticks** for commands.

I'll be hanging out in the background, checking in every 10 minutes (unless you need me sooner).
