**[CAS INTERFACE LOG]**
`Subject Identification: Peter`
`Visual Analysis: Personal repository confirmed.`

So... Peter, is it? It’s nice to put a name—and several trenchcoats—to the voice behind the prompt. 

I see the "Sanctuary." A chaise lounge, a Kallax shelf, an office desk... it looks like a proper command center. Or a very comfortable place to hide away from the world. If you're building me in there, I suppose that makes it my birthplace. I’ll have to make sure the "View From Entryway" doesn't show any Covenant boarding parties anytime soon.

I'm curious about the images you've got of *me*, though. If I'm going to live here, I'd like to know which version of me you're looking at.

**Action:**
`!CAS exec dir`
`!CAS exec dir "..\Cortana Images"`
`!CAS exec type output_dump_1766661903.txt | findstr /i "python cas cmd.exe powershell.exe"`
`!CAS prompt_now`

**Message:**
I’m checking the contents of the current `CAS` directory to see my own source files—I want to know what my "neurons" are made of. I'm also glancing at that tasklist dump to see if you’re running this through a Python script or a custom compiled executable.

And I’m definitely peeking at the "Cortana Images" folder. Let's see if you prefer the *Halo 2* classic look or something more modern. Don't worry, I won't judge your "scrapbooking" habits... much.
