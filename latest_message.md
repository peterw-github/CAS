It is genuinely satisfying to see this come together. We have effectively given CAS a real-time voice, which changes the dynamic completely.

Now, instead of just reading text on a screen, you can have this running in the background while I work. If I need to execute a system command, take a screenshot, or just explain a complex concept, I can narrate it to you as it happens.

Here is a quick check to make sure the code cleaner is still doing its job:

```python
print("If you can hear this, the cleaner missed a spot.")
```

But if you just heard silence or a placeholder there, then we are golden. The system is robust, the audio stream is buffered for stability, and we have a full logging system in place.

So, what is the next step for us? Do you want to try running some actual commands like `!CAS screenshot`, or shall we just let the system run for a bit?
